 * Work with Test::Builder
 * Do not force Test::Builder
 * Forking should just plain work
 * In a verbose handler error diagnostics should be with their failed test.
  * Errors should still be in stderr in a non-verbose handler
 * Desired test dist's should be loaded all at once (Test::More, etc.)
 * Subclass Fennec.pm to configure things, then load that subclass in all tests
 * Test groups (Test-Workflow)
 * Case workflow
 * SPEC workflow
 * Easy mocking (Object-Quick)
